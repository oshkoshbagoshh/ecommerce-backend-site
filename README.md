# e-commerce-back-end


## Description


- The goal for this project was to learn as much about back-end routing as we could by taking starter code of an e-commerce site and build out the control flow of data. 

 - This involves verifying that the API endpoints are functioning correctly, and that data can be retrieved, updated, and deleted from the database using the ORM. 


- We used node.js to run the server, sequelize to connect to our database, express to set up the server, and dotenv to hide our password and username for our database.
- We also used Insomnia to test our API routes and make sure they were working correctly.
- See below for a video of the application in action!
